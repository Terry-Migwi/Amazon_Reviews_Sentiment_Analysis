independent groups on the road  everyone probably would have laughed including the band itself  But  it's one of the more unique histories  transformations   successes in the rock archives  let alone spawning one of the most popular Christmas rock albums a musician could hope for   Briefly  with new New York guitarist Al Pitrelli  who would later spend two years kicking it the thrash way with Megadeth  Savatage recorded the excellent concept album Dead Winter Dead based upon the Bosnian War  which Atlantic Records largely considered the last chance for the band to break into needed commercial heights  The instrumental  Christmas Eve  Sarajevo          musically representing a brave lone celloist in the middle of a battlefield  gave a modern metal edge to the traditional holiday song  Carol of the Bells   This wasn't the first time the band had given traditional   or classical music metal flourishes  let alone the tradition extended back to Led Zeppelin  Yes  Emerson  Lake   Palmer   others  The single became the success the band was looking for     sort of  It's climb up the charts was marred by the band's metal sounding name that frightened radio DJs  TSO was created to boost the single past preconceived notions  though it was actually the same line up but with rotating vocalists  a slightly less venonomous stage act   a prominent composing role for Savatage session keyboards Bob Kinkel   Christmas Eve  Sarajevo         was reissued   given a new story about an angel looking for something done on Christmas Day that represents everything good  At one point he flys over Bosnia   hears a lone celloist   Christmas Eve   Other Stories pushed everything Savatage had tried before to a new level   a complex storyline as always courtesy of Paul O'Neill  a positive moral message of a strong Christian nature  radio friendly metal  operatic vocals   well known classical traditional songs given a metal twist  The jury has remained out  despite numerous albums later both holiday themed   not  on what exactly TSO is  Many metal fans don't consider it's heavily choreographed light show   radio friendly tunes true metal  while purist classical fans cry sacriledge     albeit  honestly  it doesn't take much for either group to cry out in discontent  As for everyone else listening the band has been praised to the highest   what is undeniable is that TSO appeals to the widest age bracket that any band could ever hope for  from children to grandparents  creating something for everyone     even the purists if they give it a chance   Christmas Eve   Other Stories was focused on re releasing  Sarajevo  a second year   hoping it would be a chart success again  but was essentially a one off project working alongside Savatage  As much as Savatage wouldn't have been able to predict the creation of TSO  none of them would have predicted that Savatage would also eventually completely morph into TSO  But  there's no Christmas album like this   it remains a favorite holiday album over a decade later   the highlight of the TSO catalog  let alone one of the best Christmas rock albums made     so it's really no surprise that TSO would eclipse its root band  The lyrics are sometimes a bit maudlin   cliched   the storyline takes itself too serious  but there's no questioning the widest range of musical styles any metal band could ever experiment with on a single album  let alone the high caliber of playing   singing across the board   The biggest loss  though  is Savatage vocalist Zak Stevens relegated to the chorus  as he's one of the most under rated powerhouses in rock   his operatic vocals are perfect for this project  But  luckily  he's found new success in Circle II Circle where he also gets more time in the spotlight   Speaking of lyrics  the biggest hurdle with the album is that the   page synopsis in the linear notes often puts emphasis on events that get only a passing reference in song  if not skipped at all  while the songs often focus heavily on events passed over in the synopsis  which also suffers from stilted writing  The story can't be fully understood via music along  but this is a problem shared with all the Savatage TSO albums finding a climax with Savatage's  The Wake Of Magellan  where the songs were written   then a story put over it afterwards   On later albums   on future tours TSO would eventually flesh out its ranks before expanding into two bands to bring the show to as many cities as possible in their short touring season  but on this debut it was still a small band  You don't have to wonder who is playing guitar or piano on what track as would be the case later  TSO is still a small musicial unit plodding forward with joy but also not yet sure of how far they can go with their new experiment  It's quite a contrast to     's double album Night Castle with    musicians  strings   a large choir  But  that being said  for Christmas albums this is an undoubtable highlight because it has just enough solos for the rockers but is melodic enough for everyone else  while everyone wants to sing along\",\n",

              " \"I'm a big Blondie fan  and was anxiously looking forward to this  I listened to some sound samples and felt that was more than sufficient  so I slapped down the cash and bought this deluxe fan pack  Actually  I went one step further and purchased the edition with the bonus booklet  available exclusively from another vendor   'Panic of Girls' starts off strong enough with a classic aggressive New Wave song titled D Day  complete with the  thankfully  back in vogue analog synthesizers  What a great opening track  Follow that with the strong and catchy hook of What I Heard  and one may think this will be a stellar album  That is furthered with the excellent first single  Mother  It has a Maria esque hook and is an instant classic   Unfortunately  the album falls apart after that  Without getting into the disappointment of each subsequent track  I will just state there is way too much Reggae rhythm and mid tempo snoring going on  Blondie has always been very diverse on each album  though this one lacks that diversity and stays the way of dull World music  After such a great opening few songs  the only other track maybe worth a listen is Love Doesn't Frighten Me  though it lacks a real hook and the chorus and is a bit repetitious  Some people slammed the last album  'The Curse of Blondie'  though I find that album infinitely more satisfying than this   Due to delays in getting this substandard album released  Blondie has stated they are already well underway with their next album  I will definitely listen to the sound samples much more closely before purchasing  but also feel the missing Jimmy Destri  who wrote a number of great Blondie classics  may be an added reason for this lackluster installment  I think Chris Stein may need to do a bit of a roots check\",\n",

              " \"I could not wait another month to hear the long awaited Blondie album  so I bought the expensive fan pack from Amazon uk  Truth be told  I only bought the fan pack because I wanted the two bonus tracks  They turned out to be worth it  and so was the rest of the fan pack  This is how fans should be treated  The magazine alone is worth the inflated price  It covers everything Blondie  and I mean everything  I laughed when I saw the six button pins  totally reminded me of my youth in the     's   The poster was interesting and the postcards were fine  The book like cd holder was great and this is the first time the band has not been shown clearly on one of their album covers  I wondered if this was a ploy to lure new listeners  because who wants to see senior citizens on an album cover  right  Right  America  I mean that would be totally unacceptable now wouldn't it   At any rate  the artwork of the band is cool and done in an Alice in Wonderland meets Bosch style   But let's get to the music  This is Blondie's ninth album in    years  plus five Debbie Harry solo albums scattered in between  Although I completely respect Blondie as a New Wave punk band  and I think Debbie Harry came first in many ways  I still think the band has trouble being consistent musically  When I went back and listened to all of Blondie's albums in sequential order  plus Debbie Harry's solo albums in sequential order  I found wildly inconsistent and sometimes bloated or inflated albums  More on that later    Panic of Girls  starts off strong with rumbling opener  D Day   It's the type of song that makes you think the rest of  Panic of Girls  is going to be something special  that the band has found its footing and is going to deliver a masterpiece  The second track   What I Heard   I agree should be the first single  and should be a hit like  Maria  was    years ago  It ups the ante  and keeps your hope high that  Panic for Girls  is indeed going to be a masterwork   Mother  holds steady  and in many ways feels like a amalgamation of the previous two tracks musically   The End The End  is reggae flavored and just kind of sits there  and I was thinking why does the band insist on re creating a  Tide Is High  type track    Girlie Girlie  is the better of the two reggae tracks with some humor thrown in and a better  more fully realized reggae beat   Love Doesn't Frighten Me  returns to the rocking beat of the first three tracks but isn't as memorable  That ends what could technically be perceived as the first half of the album  Good  solid  fun  somewhat uneven   Things really derail on the longer second half beginning with  Words in My Mouth  which took me several listens to enjoy  and even now it is only passable   Sunday Smile  is the third return to reggae here  but this time it's more of a ballad  and it's actually quite good  It took me several listens to realize this   Wipe Off My Sweat  is Spanish language dance club fodder that is really annoying  I hate the word Papi and Debbie sings it over and over and over  One of the worst tracks here  This is followed by the French language track  Le Bleu   I studied French in high school and college  but  Le Bleu  is the single worst track on this album   China Shoes  is okay  There's nothing overly memorable about it   The two bonus tracks   Horizontal Twist  is a great song and should have replaced either  Wipe Off My Sweat  or  Le Bleu   Instantly catchy plus humorous as well  This is a song that demonstrates what Blondie could have done right with this album  It is whimsical yet dirty and dangerous  It sounds like something fresh and original  not stale or a re tread   Mirame  is also Spanish language  but this time the band seem to do it right  Debbie's altered vocals and the Latin groove work better here  and this should have been the other replacement for either  Wipe Off My Sweat  or  Le Bleu    To wrap up  I like the fact that Debbie Harry is    and still rocking  still sounding great  and still looking hot as ever as a senior citizen  I champion this as so many other artists Debbie's age have fallen by the wayside and become boring old retirees  There is a hint in the magazine included here that Blondie are going to have another album in the future  Debbie opens the magazine by talking about the future and trying new things and making new music  I like it   Unfortunately  I have to give  Panic of Girls  three and a half stars because like many previous Blondie albums it is uneven and has some weak tracks that should have been left off  Plus  when you listen to all of Blondie's and Debbie Harry's albums in sequential order and listen to  Panic of Girls  it is apparent that it's not their best or most consistent work  but it isn't their worst  I sure like it better than     's  The Curse of Blondie    Here's how  Panic of Girls  stacks up against the band's previous works        Blondie  Three and a Half Stars

the songs on the radio and they really struck me as great story and fold songs  This was      and I was just discovering what a great artist this man is  That album is like reading a great book of short stories from a favorite author  I am sure in years to come this will be considered one of the great folk albums of all time  It was a risk but he was young and successful so he could afford to take it  He really put his heart on the vinyl and it is well worth a listen if you have never heard it  Born In The USA is a masterpiece and will be hard to ever top  The title track was perfect for the times  in the early   's longtime factory and union jobs were disappearing Steel mills  textile plants  automobile assembling were all slowing down or moving overseas  Most of these men and women were of the Vietnam era and had only known these jobs since they were kids  The song is an editorial on the time it was written  The song follows one man's journey from school tough to Vietnam and then to a good paying job  the only work he has ever known to unemployment and shrinking prospects  The song is sad and angry  It rocks  It is like a kick in the ass  I was in my early   's and serving in the military when it came out  It resonated with me because my brother had lost his good paying long term job with the local steel mill and I saw the economy falling apart when I joined the Navy to try and find my own way  We all look at the   's as boom years but the first few years of the decade saw a lot of unrest and unemployment before new industries and jobs began to be created  Dancing In The Dark  the first single off the album is a classic  It is a song of existential angst and anger but with a hint of optimism  It is the character from Born In The USA coming full circle and pulling himself off the floor and heading out for a new life  The narrator is not happy with his situation but now he is ready to do do something about it  he knows there is      something happening somewhere   ' and he is going to go out and live life again after being beaten down  It is a song of kicking yourself in the ass and heading out to experience life again  In the context of the album it works perfectly  I feel the whole album is one character going through major changes  Born In The USA     reminiscing   Darlington County  No Surrender  Bobbie Jean Glory Days  My Hometown   hitting rock bottom  Downbound Train  and finally moving forward   Dancing In The Dark  My Hometown     The album is a great listen from start to finish  The band is at the top their game  the writing is superb  the singing is fun and passionate  I have not owned a Springsteen album since this one  I know he has put together some amazing albums and I have heard a lot of the music but it too pessimistic for me  I don't hear the optimism for the future that he had in      in any of his work since then  His songs are still well crafted and sung with passion but the overall vibe for me is one of pessimism and negativity  I am sure he is just expressing what is in his heart and in the heart of many of his fans  He is a good man with a big heart for many people and charities and I

              " \"Billy Elliot  opened to rave reviews in London  but this seems to be in spite of a score by Elton John that doesn't quite thrill like it should   Yet I can see how this would be a really enjoyable show    its working class story is exactly the kind of plot that is likely to capture  my sentimentality  just as the movie did   Based on that Oscar nominated film  it's the story of a lad who just really  really wants to dance  much to the dismay of his macho dad  who's out of work during the miner strikes of        From the disc  you can tell the musical follows the film very closely  which is good  it's a solid storyline with enough song and dance opportunities to make it work   But the songs by Elton John  with some exceptions  are just sort of unremarkable   The best thing about the disc is its theatricality   I was expecting this to sound like a collection of pop songs  like the cast recording of Elton John's previous musical   Aida    What surprised me about this recording  then  is the number of musical scenes   rather than just songs  there is an interweaving of dialogue  underscoring  and catchy hooks   in other words  a real sense of musical storytelling that you didn't really get from Elton John in  Aida  or his songs for   The Lion King    Unfortunately  the best of these numbers come early on the recording   The opener   The Stars Look Down   is a hymn for the striking miners that sets exactly the right tone   somber and angry  but tinged with optimism   The next number   Shine  is an exuberant dance lesson that features Haydn Gwynn as Billy's hard edged dancing teacher  Gwynn gives an impressively dimensional performance on disc   she's the standout     Solidarity  is my favorite track overall   a scene that sets the striking miners in counterpoint to Billy's dance lessons   It's particularly well done  even if as a song it basically repeats the same refrain over and over   Solidarity  Solidarity  Solidarity forever  We're proud to be working class Solidarity forever    After those  there just isn't all that much that's stuck with me    The Letter  is nice   a touching number sung by Billy  his deceased mother  and his dance teacher    Electricity  is the obvious extractable pop song  and it's enjoyable  especially with a dance instrumental dropped in the middle of it   Another instrumental   Angry Dance   is genuinely exciting   seems like quite a rousing Act I finale   There is certainly variety in the score and the musical styles fit well with the story   But there are too many hymns for the miners  and too many so so numbers   Born to Boogie    Grandma's Song    Expressing Yourself    Deep into the Ground   and  He Could Be a Star   while not gratingly bad or anything  don't make much of an impact  either   But I do like the flow of the drama on this recording  and the cast is very capable  as Billy  Liam Mower feels like a very natural young actor singer and presumably  dancer    The lyrics by Lee Hall  who also wrote the film  are effective and often laced with profanity  which is appropriate and very much appreciated   And  Billy Elliot  does demonstrate that Elton John is stretching as a musical composer  attempting to move beyond the pop sensibilities he's known for  That being said  the songs are not as strong as they should be  and if I'm honest  I actually prefer the guilty pleasure pop ness of the  Aida  recording\",\n",
              " \"Could they make a musical of 'Billy Elliot' set in the midlands of England against the back drop of an increasingly violent coal miners strike  Well they could and they did and it's an  absolute triumph  Bold and brilliant character driven songs by Elton John and Lee Hall propel the story of 'Billy Elliot' the young lad who trades his boxing gloves for ballet slippers  Sung and acted by a terrific ensemble but special notice must be paid to Haydn Gwynne as Mrs Wilkinson  Billys tart tongued  chain smoking dance teacher and Liam Mower as Billy Elliot   From the rousing opening 'THE STARS LOOK DOWN' to the conclusion  the reprise of 'THE LETTER' through snippets of dialogue  music lyrics and even dance provide a concise narrative of the story as it unfolds   Mrs Wilkinson has a couple of strong numbers 'SHINE' and 'BORN TO BOOGIE' and she and the ballet class share a   minute stunner 'SOLIDARITY' with the picketing miners  Amazingly the two disparate plot themes play off each other beautifully  'SOLIDARITY' is perhaps the most controversial moment in the show as it is here the miners detonate the F bomb   The explosion occurs at a well timed and unexpected moment and jolts just by its sheer audaciousness and ferocity   Billy shares a bright and breezy number with his cross dressing friend Michael 'EXPRESSING YOURSELF' which features an exhausting 'chase' dance break   Billy also sings the contents of 'THE LETTER' written to him by his dying mother and he imagines her singing it with him in a lovely and poignant duet   Then there's the thunderbolt 'ANGRY DANCE' which is a confrontation between Billy and his father and a confrontation between the miners and the police   With Elton Johns pulsating  driving music and Billys floor pounding dance and yells it's the musical equivelant of riding on an out of control rollercoaster without holding onto the safety bar   It leaves you exhilerated and breathless   The miners have a lighter moment at a Union Christmas party where they offer a back handed tribute to their nemesis  'MERRY CHRISTMAS  MAGGIE THATCHER' and a Merry Christmas is not what they are wishing for her   'ELECTRICITY' is Billys reply to a question at his Royal Ballet audition  what is it you feel when you are dancing ' and this leads to a dance break which samples a bit of 'Swan Lake' an echo of 'Riverdance' and rock and this heady mix sparks and crackles like    electricity   There are other gems in this score such as 'GRANDMAS' SONG' 'HE COULD BE A STAR' and 'ONCE WE WERE KINGS' where the victorious miners not really their union caves  sing full throated and loudly as they head back to the mines   As Billy prepares to leave home he shares a final moment with his 'mother'  'THE LETTER' reprise and after a choked up goodbye from his friend Michael the show ends as Billy  suitcase in hand  walks onto a stage toward a bank of stagelights   This end is depicted in the accompanying booklet   'THE FINALE' which is the actors bows is unusual as the entire ensemble tap dances to the musical excerpts from the show   'Billy Elliot' has to be one of the best if not the best cast recording in many years and no praise from me can do full justice to the brilliance of this enthralling CD  BRAVO\",\n",

              " \"When the movie  Billy Elliot'  written by Lee Hall and directed by Stephen Daldry  hit the cinemas in the year       both the critics and the audiences where somewhat taken aback  It became an instant success  defying the customs of the day by not having star names or a big Hollywood blockbuster director in its credit lines  A simple story  about a young talented boy growing up in the English north  during the      miners strike against Margaret Thatcher's conservative government  wanting to pursue his dream of becoming a ballet dancer and thusly going against everything his own establishment and surroundings stood for  beautifully summarised in a phrase used in both the movie and the musical   ballet is for poofs'   seemed to deliver the message and hit the critics and the cinemagoers alike  Apart from these accolades the movie got several BEFTA and Academy Award nominations   After seeing the Cannes screening of the movie that literally sent him home in tears  Elton John  who at the time already had a name in the world of musical theatre as the composer of  The Lion King' and  Aida' in his collaboration with Tim Rice  was certain that the movie has all the potential for a musical adaptation  It is quite a good thing that he stuck to the idea and even more  he decided to use the original creative team that was involved with the movie and had both the knowledge of and love for the material  Thusly the director Stephen Daldry directed and Lee Hall the screenwriter wrote the lyrics for the musical version  After the musical started its previews in March      it was praised by the critics as the best thing that happened to the British musical theatre in years and has been playing to the full house in London's Victoria Palace Theatre night after night  Among other things it won the prestigious Laurence Olivier Award as the best musical   This CD cast recording catches all the main musical numbers of the production  The score Elton John composed for this occasion is quite different from his prior show  Aida'  The latter had some exceptional pop  rock and roll and gospel numbers that won you over after the first listen  This is a bit different  Some of the numbers are deeply rooted into the framework of the North English area where the action takes place  This means we have some gorgeous working class hymns  songs of male choirs and club rock and roll music  They are all very well made  but it is not something that will probably make you ecstatic in an Andrew Lloyd Webber sense after the first listen  With a couple of listening  however  the score just grows on you so much you keep revisiting it over and over again  Several of the songs in the canon  however  hit you in the heart from the start  Some of the examples are   The stars look down'  a very melodic opening anthem sung by the miners expressing their pledge to remain loyal to their just cause and honest way of life    The letter'  a guaranteed tearjerker  a moving song in form of a letter written to Billy by his late mum before she died    Electricity'  a big showstopper with Billy's elaborate dancing and explaining the way he feels when he dances  and a simple yet touching  He could be a star'  when Billy's dad decides to end his strike against the majority of his co workers and go back to work so that he could help his son go to an audition to  The Royal Ballet School in London   Other numbers are downright funny  such as  Grandma's song'  in which Billy's old and a bit senile nan deliberates about the painful life the women of her age had no choice but to lead after they got married very young    Expressing yourself'  a hilarious number where young Billy joins his best friend  a nice closeted cross dresser gay guy Michael in wearing a women's tacky clothes of the    is  but this is rather a call for a need to support each person's individuality and be tolerant  and a giggling song called  Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher'  where the mining community expresses their disapproval of their political foe at their annual Christmas party   As a whole  Elton John has made his most ambitious musical theatre score up to date with this  Lee Hall's lyric reflect the language of the area and are very witty   Some of the numbers must be seen on the stage to be fully appreciated  so the best thing to do would be to see the show in London  As someone who just did that  I can say it is definitely worth your time and money   The cast on this CD does a very good job  Billy is portrayed by Liam Mower  one of the three boys who were originally selected to play the role  due to the fact that one child actor could not do such a demanding job six nights plus two matinees a week  Liam has a voice of an angel and he deservedly won his Laurence Oliver award  becoming the youngest person ever to do so  His vocals transfer all of the characters actions and emotions in the perfect way  His grumpy and encouraging ballet teacher  Mrs  Wilkinson  is played with much gusto by Haydn Gwynne  who puts on a great accent at that  Stephanie Putson evokes sadness with her short appearances as Billy's dead mum  Ultimately  it is the whole ensemble with these talented soloists that manages to deliver this touching story   The single CD comes with some credits and production pictures  but no synopsis or lyrics are included  which can be quite hard for the people who are not familiar with the story  There is also a   disc edition  with a second disc where Elton John himself performs a couple of songs  and that one features the lyrics  The best thing to do would be to see the original movie before listening to this cast recording   At the end of the day   Billy Elliot' comes as a true winner in the current offer of the West End  The story can be applied to everyone who wants to pursue their own dreams or just simply to express themselves in the best way they can  This cast recording serves as a good testimony of the show that will fulfil you in a most rewarding way if you ever have a chance to see it  but it works just fine as an ordinary cast recording  The second best thing next to seeing this show alive would be a good DVD issue of this musical  so that is something to hope upon while listening to this CD at home\",\n",

is basically Guns N'Roses with a new singer and new rhythm guitarist  Lead guitarist Slash   bassist Duff McKagen  and drummer Matt Sorum  also former member of The Cult  are here  filled out with rhythm guitarist Dave Kushner and vocalist Weiland  The band recorded the song  Set Me Free  for the movie  Hulk  and the song fared better than the movie did  but the first album took a while to see a release because Weiland got busted for heroin during recording  When the album was released it got mixed reviews  People complained and complain about everything they can think of   The band isn't as good as STP or GN'R  the CD won't go into my Ipod  the CD is copy protected  I'm here to say some good things about the album  I'm a huge fan of STP and GN'R  True  Velvet Revolver isn't  at this point  better than either band  Consider this  though  Both bands released   albums  this is the only Velvet Revolver album so far  In the future  This band could be better than both bands  Also  you can't judge a band by saying that the songs aren't as good as those of the previous  Judge the songs for how good they are and not how good they are compared to other ones  Comparing a song by a new band to a song by the older version of the band is like saying  Set Me Free  isn't as good as Led Zeppelin's  Stairway to Heaven   OK  All the songs on this album are great  They're all catchy and guitar driven  It's nice to hear Slash back in action  Weiland has always been one of my favorite vocalists  a singer with incredible range  My biggest complaint about the album is the lyrics  Not only is Weiland is a great vocalist  but also a great lyricist  He has written some of my favorite lyrics  either as a whole or in part  Examples include Wicked Garden  Wonderful  and I Got You  Here  his lyrics seem half a  ed  The lyrics that I really like on the album are only because I can relate to some of the lines  If you're one of those people who don't like Scott Weiland  but love his lyrics and are only buying the album for those  Then you shouldn't get this album  Here  the songs are best judged by their arrangement  Here are the tracks and my opinions  If you're a fan of STP or GN'R  you definitely need to hear this album  For the record the two members of STP  The DeLeo Brothers  formed a band called Army of Anyone who released a terrific self titled CD      Sucker Train Blues     A great way to begin the album  Establishes the feel of the record  I've always been a fan of Weiland's lyrics  but on this song it feels like he was trying to write unique lyrics that are unique  but not that good      Do It for the Kids     Some of the lyrics in this song are good  The song is one of my favorite on the album  cause it's catchy and has great music to it      Big Machine     Also a catchy song  although the lyrics sound like the soundtrack to Paris Hilton's life      Illegal i Song     This song has its merits  It's slower and the verses are much better than the chorus  but it's a great song anyway      Spectacle     I know I've been talking about the lyrics a little too much  but here I go again     The lyrics don't make a whole lot of sense to the average guy  Reading and listening to them  I was struck by how much I can relate to them  However one line in the song   Rocket b  ch is blasting off   seems like a rehash of a line in the STP song  Hollywood B  ch    Blow up the b  ch with the firecracker smile        Fall to Pieces     One of the singles off the album  this showcases Weiland's superb vocal abilities  It's one of the slowest songs on the album  but also one of the best      Headspace     A great song      Superhuman     Not only is this song really good  a great guitar hook courtesy of Slash   but it's got some of the best lyrics on the album      Set Me Free     The first song Velvet Revolver recorded and the first I ever heard is really good  Catchy and well arranged  Weiland makes it even more clear on this song how different he can make his voice sound       You Got No Right     It's a slow song that slowly builds  Despite the fact it sounds like an outtake off of the softest STP album  it's a song I like a lot       Slither     This is  probably  the most popular song off the album  It's got a decent chorus and a great guitar solo but it's one of the weaker songs on the album       Dirty Little Thing     This is one of my favorite songs on the album and might even be my favorite  I love the music  I love the way Weiland sings it  and Slash's solo is incredible  It's a song with great verses  a great bridge  and a great chorus       Loving the Alien     A lot of people could say that the Revolver ends with a wimper rather than a bang  as this is a slow song  I love it  It's a return to songs like  Creep  and  Wonderful  where Weiland shows a lot of feeling through his voice   GRADE  A\",\n",

              " \"I was sceptical when I first heard that they were doing this album  Guns n Roses were one of the bands that turned my ear in the rock direction  leading me to weave my way through virtually anything recorded with guitars  And let me tell you there have been some turkeys I've found that had a fantastic line up of band members  I am also a big fan of the 'grunge' scene  including Stone Temple Pilots   I knew that Weilands voice wouldnt be an issue  as he has the ability to fit in with any vocal style out there in the rock world  My worries were that it would be a re hash of Guns n Roses with a different singer  which was not what I wanted to hear  What we got instead was great rhythms and melodies throughout the music  mixed with Scott's awesome vocals  creating an unmissable mix  Plenty of people on here have slagged off the production  which is a very good mix to me  Its not over produced  nothings compressed or held back  Its also allowed an edge that gives it rawness without it being trashy  The producers background really has nothing to do with his ability to work with non nu metal  and I think he's done an admirable job of allowing each instruments to shine  while not over emphacising the vocals as many producers have a tendancy to do   Musically the album is a joy from start to finish  It has a sound similar to what I would expect  but without being Guns n Roses    Slash and the boys have done a wonderful job of creating a fresh sound with interesting hooks  while Scott Weiland voice and lyrics bring the same freshness and delightful approach  They've definitely laid down a benchmark for Axl to have to reach high to atain with the long awaited Chinese Democracy   This could be a battle of the bands to watch   Long may they continue\",\n",

              " \"Its been over a year since Contraband was released   And almost exactly a year since I bought it   I was   at first somewhat sketchy about this album   I'd been a Guns n' Roses fan for awhile but had never owned a Stone Temple Pilots album   I was also  at the time  beginning to believe that modern rock was stuck in a stagnant sea of pathetic ballads and wanna be punk posers   Contraband is true rock   The kind of true rock the   s was made of   Its hard and heavy but still holds a very modern vibe and some echoes of the   s grunge scene   It is because of this record that I now own every STP album and Scott Weiland's solo record   all of which are quite excellent    Contraband basically lived in my cd player from july      through September   Its longevity and immense perfect have maintained it in my mind as being the best rock album of the new millennium and my favourite hard rock record of all time      Sucker Train Blues        Definately a cool opener  That siren's sounds neat at the begining  it's heavy and it makes you hope the rest of the songs are this hard  But it doesn't really stand out  atleast in comparison to some of the other numbers      Do It for the Kids         Very bitchin' song  Cheap sex  Very cool  Scott's lyrics are just perfect in this one      Big Machine        At first i thought this was too generic to be likable  Kinda sounds like a lot of modern bands  But Duff's bass line and Scott's creepy vocals make up for the meticulous chorus      Illegal i Song        Angry  raw  Diffenitaly a nice number  But it gets old after awhile  He repeats the same lines over and over again  But it still rocks hard and that stands for something      Spectacle        I'm not sure why i like this one so much  but i do  The chorus is pretty neat  Another angry song  All the crap Scott was going through when he wrote these lyrics really stands out  Nice guitar solo too      Fall to Pieces        Anyone reading this has probably heard this song by now  Personally i don't see why so many people like it so much  There are    power ballads  on Contraband and this is by far the weakest  It's good and deep and all that jive  But i just feel it sounds too polished in comparison to the rest of the songs  Maybe that's just me though  Cause i know a lot of people who think this song's amazing      Headspace        Really hard song  Loud  riddled with cussing  It's bad a    but does drag on a bit      Superhuman         Amazing song  One of my faves  Song about drugs and sex  Lovely  The whole thing really works out to make one awesome heavy tune      Set Me Free        My least favourite song  I try never to skip a song when i listen to this album  but i sometimes skip this one  it's kind of annouying  Really only the chorus   but it's sung so much that it over rides the good aspects  Those being that it's a fast rockin song that sounds    thousands times better than Houbastank or Yellowcard       You Got No Right         Every time i hear this one i get goose bumps  It's really well done  The best of the slow songs  The lyrics are diffenitaly cool   funny right here i find myself inside a paper cup   without a warning or a reason   it's a treason with no answer        Slither         What can i say about this that hasn't already been said  Okay  it's the most STP influenced song on here  Which is a good thing  cause most of this sounds like G n' R with Scott Weiland playing Axl  They outta do more stuff like this on the  nd album  In general the whole song's killer  Guitar's awesome  bass  drums   everything  and as always Scott sounds superb       Dirty Little Thing         I hope i'm not the first person to notice this   but doesn't this song sound more than just a little like  Sex Type Thing   it's like Slash  Duff  and Matt were sitting around listening to Core while writing the music  The lyrics arn't like  Sex Type Thing  though   which is a pity cause i love that song   This tune's about substance abuse  lying   all that good stuff  makes for an awesome song  Very   s feel   like  My Michelle  or  It's So Easy        Loving the Alien        Beautiful  Really beautiful  It's heart felt and powerful  though one of the downsides is Slash totally ripped off himself and just re did Sweet Child o' Mine as far as the guitar work is concerned  But a lot of people think that's cool  so whatever  in short a really nice song  Good closer for the record  Leaves you feeling wistful like   In conclusion Contraband is the single best record I've heard in YEARS  I'm only    and  priour to this  i was really trippin over the fact that i'd never hear good NEW music  This record blows all those other  rock  bands away  and it's a breath of fresh air from all the rap hip hop crap that plagues the radio continually  I don't think i've ever been happier to have spent    pounds in my life  Even if you're unsure about getting this album get it anyway  If you're a fan of Guns n'

              " \"I've already written a      word   review on CONTRABAND  EXPLICIT LYRICS    Since Amazon will not allow me to write two reviews  I decided to post this here   Basically  it's just about the Autorun MediaMax licensing iPod issues with Contraband and how to stop it   Anything can be broken  This includes the MediaMax software that autolaunches on the Velvet Revolver CD  Let's break it down this way  Insert the CD in your computer  up pops a mandatory  MediaMax  box that asks you to accept to their terms and agreements  You do  and they install a file on your PC  including licenses that confirm you've purchased the CD   and allow you to play the music on your PC   You're then taken to a new Velvet Revolver CD menu where you are given the opportunity to  Play music  rip music to hard drive  as read only  non editable WMA files   go to band's official website  etc   The problem many people have been having with this is that they feel somehow cheated because WMA  Windows Media Audio   recorded at    Kpbs  is NOT transferrable to Apple iPods   Which only support MP        Kpbs format   and Apple iTunes  which you must pay for to download   So for the computer illiterate out there   people who buy this CD in hopes of ripping tracks to their iPod are out of luck  Most MP  players do not support WMA files  either  Once copied to your hard drive  all Velvet Revolver tracks are totally  locked    i e   you can't edit them at all  I tried to put them through Switch  a freeware program that changes file formats   e g  MP  to WMA or WMA to MP   and because I had installed the MediaMax file on my PC  it  detected  that I was trying to change the format of the track and didn't allow me to do so   For me it wasn't a problem because my MP  player supports WMA  However I can understand the frustration of being an iPod owner and not being able to transfer files   However  as I said  anything can be broken  including Media Max  You have a few options  First  When the Velvet Revolver CD autolaunch starts  hold down the SHIFT key on your PC  This somehow disables it  I haven't tried this  Someone told me it works  I can't guarantee it   What I did  and which I think is the wisest thing to do for a number of reasons  is simply disable Autorun on your Windows system  This prevents the CD from autostarting when you insert it into your CD ROM DVD ROM drive  It therefore stops the CD from downloading the nasty MediaMax file to your hard drive  which in turn prevents the file from  blocking  the  protected  music from being played on your PC until you download the proper licenses   This is easy to change  In Windows click   Start   Run  Type regedit  Press  ENTER   A screen should pop up  Next  search for  and click   HKEY LOCAL MACHINE   SYSTEM   CurrentControlSet   Services   Cdrom   Double click on  Autorun   It should be set at      Change it to       Click OK  Now  restart your PC  If it asks you to enable Autorun when you boot up again  say NO and it shouldn't ask you again   This is the most effective way to disable Autorun completely on your PC   Now  after restarting your PC  insert the Velvet Revolver CD in your CD drive  Nothing should pop up   Open Windows Media player  Select RIP TRACKS  Now  rip all the tracks to your PC   They'll still be recorded as Windows Media Audio files by default  but this is changeable  By default any CD copied to your PC will be WMA  if you're using Windows to rip it  so it isn't exclusive for Velvet Revolver's Contraband  In fact you should be able to select ripping options somewhere in Windows Media Player's toolbar options  I don't know as I haven't tried   Either way  once they're ripped to your hard drive  they are now totally editable  You don't need to download a license to play them  You can copy them to your MP  without trouble  And since the license isn't stopping you  you can also now use a freeware program such as Switch  do a Google search for it  to convert the file into standard MP       Kpbs  and transfer them to your iPod   See  Wasn't that simple   It's not worth endlessly complaining about and returning CDs to stores     just because of MediaMax  which is now being included on many CDs as protection    The first person to exploit this Autorun flaw in MediaMax was a college student who wrote a paper on it  They're currently suing him for     million   Anyway   in summary  If you are frustrated because you can't copy Contraband to your iPod  just disable autorun  Then proceed with what you'd normally do to transfer tracks to your iPod   It's that simple\",\n",
              " \"Contraband is a great CD   period   Lately  all of the hip  modern rock   most seems invariably to flow towards angst filled punk wannabe or estrogen filled soft crap   Velvet Revolver provides a welcome deviation from this plagued  and oftentimes  prosaic  genre   Going into it  I was wondering if the whole album was like  Fall to Pieces  or even worth buying  The answer  No and Yes   And No to the first question is a good thing   I love  Fall to Pieces   but if every song sounded alike  it would be pure unbridled torture   The CD takes a few listens to truly feel it   Once you do  though  you won't take it out of your car CD player    Big Machine  is my favorite song    due to its unparalleled power  emotion  and singular antiestablishment message   The focus and intensity of Weiland that was lacking from STP's last   efforts is back   A little FYI  Take a gander at the lyrics in the foldout on the first listen to truly experience this CD  Rest assured  this band is not merely a one CD wonder\",\n",

              " \"Before I start my review let me address a few issues   one other reviewer noted that the CD has copy protection and he was unable to copy tracks to his MP  player  so he returned the CD  First of all  this is a pretty dishonest reason to return a working CD to a store  Second of all  if you weren't in such a rush to download it to MP  you would have noticed that the CD has an autostart program that  once loaded  lets you rip the tracks as read only to your hard drive   you can then copy these tracks to your MP  player  First thing I did after bringing the CD home was pop it in my computer  rip the tracks to the hard drive  plug in my MP  player and transfer them  They show up on the MP  player  my Rio Nitrus  with all details   album  band  artist  and the music transfer is identical to the CD's quality   I only bring this up because  SO  many people have been complaining that they couldn't copy tracks here  Instead of exiting the autolaunch program when it pops up  try reading first  It's that simple   So with that out of the way  let me move on to the actual CD itself  Being a huge Guns N' Roses fan  and an infrequent listener of Stone Temple Pilots  I had looked forward to this CD  To be honest I only started listening to Gn'R etc  recently but quickly became die hard   I had downloaded  Set Me Free  months ago not realizing it was from the  Hulk  soundtrack  I had been searching for Velvet Underground tracks on Kazaa and one of my searches accidentally picked up Velvet Revolver  I listened to the song and loved it but had no clue what it was as it was incorrectly labeled as Velvet Underground   Anyway   I later found out after seeing the track listed online  After becoming immersed in Guns N' Roses I immediately ran out to my local store and picked up Contraband after realizing that Duff  Slash and Matt were all in the band   Izzy also performed live with them in concert a few times  although those tracks are not included on the CD    I have two confessions   I don't think Scott Weiland's voice is particularly suited for hard rock  Or  let me expand upon that   when I listen to Axl screeching away during  Sweet Child O' Mine  it sends shivers down my spine  He just has the perfect raspy voice for hard rock   I listen to  Dead Horse  and can't get enough of it  Scott's voice is a bit less distinct   he doesn't stand out like Axl  I can't imagine anyone else singing  Welcome to the Jungle    whereas Weiland never really struck me that way when I listened to STP   My second confession is that  to be totally honest  I didn't much care for the CD at first  As another reviewer here noted  it takes about three listens to really start enjoying it  Their hit singles  Fall to Pieces  and  Slither  are generally regarded to be the best from the CD  and some people on Amazon have accused the rest of being shameless filler   But you know what  After playing it a few times  I've come to realize  well  at least in my opinion  that there isn't a single bad track on this CD  Not a single one  How's that for impressive      Sucker Train Blues   I didn't like it the first time but it's quickly become one of my favorites off the CD  Slash's guitar playing is great  Weiland's voice is suitably scratchy and it has the whole punk blues rock rhythm that Slash was yearning for when he left Gn'R in '   '     Axl wanted to start making different kind of music   can't say I blame him but then again I can't blame Slash for disagreeing       Do it for the Kids   great opening line   Went too fast I'm outta luck and I don't even give a      I became addicted to that part  The song has a great beat  a great rhythm  great guitar playing and awesome lyrics  The chorus is really catchy      Big Machine   not the best on the CD  in fact one of the lesser tracks  but nevertheless at   minutes and    seconds it's a fun listen      Illegal i Song   great opening  pretty interesting  whine  voice from Weiland   but after a while it can become a bit grating as it's pretty repetitive  Probably the second worst on the CD   but it's still a good song      Spectacle   another great opening  catchy rhythm and beat  Weiland's voice isn't so memorable here because it sort of gets drowned out by the loud guitar playing   but that's not necessarily a bad thing in this case      Fall to Pieces   arguably the best song on the entire CD  it became the ultra successful hit single they released alongside  Slither   Probably my favorite rock song in years  it's really epic and emotionally moving with great lyrics and guitar playing  I'm not always a huge fan of Weiland's voice for rock music as I said above but here it really matches because it's a slow  soft rock power ballad  Awesome stuff  Here's a song I actually can't imagine Axl singing   which says something for the quality of the band      Headspace   pretty catchy  Not really epic or anything like  Fall to Pieces  but a really good rock beat and Weiland's great here  I love the line   Don't let any of those f    s in my headspace       Superhuman   one of the lesser tracks  a bit too repetitious  Nevertheless the opening is great with  I wanna be your superman    really catchy  I'm surprised this was not included on the  Hulk  soundtrack  for obvious reasons      Set Me Free   the most underrated song on the album  This was the first VR track I ever heard and it's amazing  It definitely has more of a Stone Temple Pilots  Big Bang Baby   Sex Type Thing  going for it with Weiland doing his low pitch mumbling voice  which I love  He's really good at this and it makes him stand out more than when he's just singing straightforward  Great lyrics  great solo by Slash   second best song on the album if I do say so myself       You Got No Right   A good  slower pace for the band  Good lyrics  soft beat   not great guitar playing or anything but powerful in a different sort of way  An understated song   doesn't leave much of an impression but it has some really  really good vocals by Weiland  This  along with  Loving the Alien   see below  proves that VR could make just as much an impact in the slow rock world as the hard rock       Slither   one of the best on the album  almost as good as  if not as good as   Set Me Free   The only problem I have is that it's become so successful compared to  Set Me Free  that you could claim it's a bit overrated over popularized  because in my opinion it's not as good as  Fall to Pieces   Still  it's an instant classic and fun to listen to       One of the lesser songs on the album  I'm disappointed to hear this will be their next single music video   I mean it's pretty good but doesn't hold anything against the others  That said  I guess it would be a great song to play if you're working out or something and are in need of some adrenaline boost  It's got a catchy hard rhythm  Also  the music video is going to be unique   it will start as animation on a moving train   Polar Express  anyone   and transform abruptly into reality       Loving the Alien   another underrated instant classic  This is by far one of the best songs of the decade so far  that's right   and a great change of pace for VR  It's sort of refreshing to find it as the last track of the CD   it implies a few thing  First it lets us know these guys can do more than just hard rock  and second of all it becomes a sort of cliff hanger   on VR's second album will we hear more hard rock or maybe a bit more like this  This is the equivalent of Gn'R's  Patience  or  November Rain    it's a huge change of pace and shows they can be more than loud and  ugly   not that that's necessarily a bad thing  But you know what I mean    Either way  if they have more hard rock or more soft rock on their next album  I'll be listening  This is one of the most impressive  refreshing and important albums released in decades   it's not as influential as Appetite for Destruction for obvious reasons  after all  it's comprised of  power players  as Amazon says   famous ex band mates who are already extremely famous and as a result the album seems a bit more commercial than  say  an independent breakthrough like Destruction    But I don't care  It might be a bit more commercialized than some of us would like but it's still a great  great album  In a time when people are listening to Avril Lavigne and lip synchers like Lindsay Lohan  she's a singer now just because she's made a few movies   and Hilary Duff  ditto  it's refreshing to find a band that still knows how to make some great rock music  They're bringing the    s back   I really thought Duff would have gotten a haircut by now   Judging by the sales of the record  a quarter million upon release in June I heard   it seems a  lot  of people have been waiting for something like this to come around  Maybe  just maybe  this will spark more interest in the hard rock influence of the '  s early '  s   before grunge took over and destroyed it  Highly  highly recommended   just remember when you're listening that first impressions aren't always permanent ones\",\n",

are the real deal  Next up is the radio friendly  Don't Look Back    anyone from Sheryl Crow to the Dixie Chicks could have covered this gem and had a hit with it  but it's Antigone Rising's  and they're holding on to it  Once again  the instrumentation is smooth and precise  the vocal top notch  A real winner  Things get edgier with  She's Not Innocent     the arrangement's a bit more frenetic  the vocals darker  almost a tad menecing  As Cassidy wraps her considerable pipes around the cryptic lyrics   He shines the light into the dark and empty corner right where the past had left it's mark too late to warn her    the song builds in intensity  culminating in a powerful  yet melodic  bridge  Another high point  There's a simple honesty to  Open Hearts And Doors  that's absolutely lovely  I bet Sarah  Alicia and Mariah would've KILLED to have written this beauty    while  Michael 's reflection on loss  the past and the desire to change it is both universal and touching   Happy Home  is a wonderful blending of influences and styles    take one part Indigo Girls  add a dose of Ann and Nancy Wilson  mix in a pinch of the Dixie Chicks    and you have this infectious toe tapper  The instrumentation is economical  the vocals silky  yet strong  WIN NER   You're The Reason  is a slice of blues rock paradise  equal parts Joplin and Joss Stone  Cassidy's vocals weave in and out of Cathy Henderson's smart guitar runs  while Jan Zielenbach's powerhouse bass lines anchor the track in a rootsy  atmospheric manner  Things are toned down a notch or ten on the delicate  Longshot   a pained love song in the same vein as Bonnie Raitt's brilliant  I Can't Make You Love Me   Cushioned by strumming guitars  Cassidy caresses the lyrics   It's easy now when I look back They call that 'retrospect' if I had known that night would have such a ripple effect I might have been more likely just to let that sleeping dog lie   with a vocal that is both raw and vulnerable  Another beauty  The group's ability to blend styles and sounds so effortlessly is also obvious on the laid back  Better     any female country artist out there today  from Reba and Faith to Martina and Shania  could have had a HUGE hit with this song   but it could have also worked for Joss Stone  Mary J  Blige or Norah Jones  Heck  even Diana Krall could've pulled off a smooth  jazzy version  It's that universal appeal that makes the song so stunning  Once again  Cassidy's vocals are amazing  the harmonies are spot on  Dena Tauriello's drumming shines and the guitars   Cathy Henderson on lead  sister Kristen on rhythm   float out of the speakers in an almost hypnotic way  WOW  Then  just when you might be thinking things are getting a bit too mellow  the group kicks things up with the funky  She Lived Here   All snarling vocals and clever arrangement  both the keyboards and percussion really shine   the ladies might consider adding another female multi instrumentalist to the band instead of using male sidemen   both instruments really add something to the mix  and having a woman play them would only add to the band's legitimacy as a self contained all female unit   this track ROCKS    Rosita   a song about dashed dreams and fruitless fantasies  has a spirited flamenco vibe to it  while  Broken  is both sweet and sad  Parents can often question their children's choices  but those same children often have doubts about their parent's lives as well   Mother mine's a foolish game but the same could be said said about yours He took your youth and he took your name    The track is powerful and poignant  and would have been a great album closer  Instead  we get a radio edit version of  Don't Look Back  and a so so studio cut   Should've Been The One   That said  I know it's not enough for Antigone Rising to be the best all female band to come down the pike in ages    if they're to last  they'll have to move beyond said novelty and just prove themselves as a BAND  However  if FROM THE GROUND UP is any indication  the women of Fanny must be letting out a collective sigh of relief   maybe all they went thru over three decades ago wasn't a waste after all  As with all my reviews  I'm giving the disc an extra half a star for including the lyrics\",\n",

than nothing  As for Guns n Roses  I was never a huge fan  I did enjoy most of their radio singles  if nothing else   but Slash  Duff  and the rest of the gang are all great respective musicians     Sucker Train Blues Fast paced  heavy opener built around a heavy bass line  The chorus has a good hook  and I love the guitar solo towards the end  Overall  a good song  no complaints     Do It For the Kids  A heavy arena rocker  Again  nice guitar work  and a pretty catchy chorus due to Scott's vocal delivery     Big Machine Starts off a hypnotic drum bass combo  then the guitars really kick in for the chorus as Scott sings   It's a big machine  it's a big machine  we're all slaves to the big machine   There's a nice little bridge too  Sleazy and fun  A standout     Illegal I Song Another heavy song  The verses are loud and angry  but again  the chorus has a good hook   Just look and you'll see me  lyyyyyyin there   lyyyyyyin there     Scott has become a pro with his vocal delivery  The bridge is an instrumental spoken word ish thing  then back into the chorus  Scott screams  Just look at you   repeatedly as the song comes to a halt     Spectacle Yet another really heavy song  The main guitar riff is pretty killer  nice drum work  really cool guitar solo  decent chorus  Pretty much like all the previous songs  But at this point  you're kinda aching for them to slow things down a bit     Fall To Pieces Sure enough  here comes the power ballad  And it's  excellent   a total standout  and my favorite song on the album  There's a definite GnR feel to it  Very memorable vocal performance from Scott  and I love Slash's guitar arpeggios in the chorus  It'll probably be a single     Headspace Another  good but not particularily  memorable hard rocker  Not much else to say     Superhuman A Flaming Lips cover  Oh wait  that was  Superhumans   Starts off with a cool little electronic sounding guitar riff  The verses are bass heavy  pre chorus has a neat vocal melody  chorus is kinda generic  Decent  nothing special     Set Me Free This was on the Hulk soundtrack last year  I only heard it a couple times last summer  but I was never crazy about it  Now that I hear it again  it's actually pretty decent  The main guitar riff is cool  and that so is the  My Freedom  part at the end      You Got No Right Doesn't that sound like a GnR song title  Accoustic guitar at the beginning  it's another ballad  which is fine  because it's nice to hear Scott actually sing  the guy does have a great voice  once and awhile  It gets heavier towards the end  with an anthematic bridge  and Slash guitar solo  A really good song with an STP feel to it      Slither The first single  I'm sure everyone has heard it  I gotta say  I like how they put it towards the end of the album  I hate how some bands put all the singles right at the beginning  sometimes right in a row   It's annoying  like   Here's our singles  and a bunch of crappy songs after it   Anyway  I didn't like it the first couple times I heard it on the radio MTV  but it grew on me in a major way  Great song  very catchy chorus  It also has an STP feel to it  but that guitar solo at the end is pure Slash      Dirty Little Thing Another GnR sounding title  Musically  it's heavy  raucous  doesn't cover any new ground  but it's not bad  The guitar solo towards the end rules      Loving the Alien Loving the Alien  Um  kay  Primarily an accoustic ballad  Has a nice  laid back  bluesey feel to it  Scott sings falsetto during the  excellent  bridge  and Slash gives another great guitar solo  Really good closer  Okay  so I like this album  Do I love it  No  not yet at least  I've only listened to it a couple times  so it may grow on me   But it's pretty much what I expected  Most  supergroups   unfortunately  never really cover a whole lot of new ground  and make you long for the respective bands that they formed from  I must say though  this is much better than another supergroup's recent debut album   that being Audioslave  The two albums are pretty similar too  in the sense that they're comprised primarily of hard rockers with a few ballads thrown in  But whereas Audioslave's ballads were either boring   I Am the Highway    plodding   I Am the Highway    or a god awful combination of both   Like a Stone    the ones on  Contraband  really shine  especially  Fall to Pieces   As for the hard rockers   Sucker Train Blues    Big Machine   and  Slither  stand out the most after the first listen  The others are also good  balls out songs to crank up and play air guitar to  but nothing that really makes you go  WOW   So in conclusion  I paid       for this album  and I definetly feel like I got my money's worth  By no means a terrific album  but it's a solid  above average one  Now excuse me while I listen to  Liars  by Todd Rundgren again  Best Songs  Fall To Pieces  Big Machine  Loving the Alien  You Got No Right  Slither\",\n",

band mates had different ideas about where the band should be heading  so the original instrumentalists disbanded with Axl Rose while Rose hired new instrumentalists  Meanwhile  Slash  Duff  Matt Sorum  and Dave Kushner set out to find a new singer  and their search even chronicled on VH 's  The Project   As if the stars had aligned  the Stone Temple Pilots had recently recorded the rather  dull  Shangri La Dee Da   which Scott Weiland was not very fond of  since it sounded more like a Barry Manilow album than the Grunge he originally was trying to do  So  after releasing the Greatest Hits compilation  Thank You   the Stone Temple Pilots officially disbanded  With Scott on the unemployed list  Slash and Weiland met in a club where they became fast friends  Then  after getting the band together  they immediately began jamming on a song that would eventually become  Slither   Around the radio's constant playing of  Slither  and all the buzz around this CD  will it hold up  Well  when you combine Guns 'N Roses style with the grungy sounds of Stone Temple Pilots  you get a combination that works throughout the album like a charm  Track Ratings  Sucker Train Blues        Starts off with a crazy guitar riff behind a police siren that perfectly sets the stage for the album  you're in for a crazy ride  Weiland's vocals immediately take center stage  and he shows us he can still sing with the best of them  Great chorus that really enhances the song  plus as a treat you get great drumming from Sorum and a crazy solo from Slash  Do It For The Kids        Duff's bass line and Slash's riff sets the tone for this song  almost a sarcastic one  Weiland's vocals back up the instruments perfectly  and his chorus is one of the best on the album  This is a really angry song  just read the lyrics  Big Machine       Starts off slow with a little bass beat with Weiland whispering about  The Big Machine   then Slash's guitar jumps in and he drops a killer riff with Weiland's spooky vocals backing it up  Illegal i Song       Starts off with Sorum's killer drumming and immediately Slash jumps in with a dark riff that sets the stage and Weiland comes on  and his vocals are very angry  but they soften up considerably for the chorus where his vocals sound very soulful  Spectacle        Superb riff from Slash starts off this song  and I can't stop humming this song  Weiland's vocals aren't his best  but he sings the chorus as good as on any other song  Slash really steals the show here  with his crazy riff and his Guns N Roses y solo that is amazing  Fall to Pieces        One of the slowest songs on the album  it certainly isn't bad because of that and stands as a very heartfelt song  An acoustic guitar starts it off behind Weiland's soul searching vocals  and Slash continues it on with his combination of acoustic and electric guitar playing that is phenomenal  and his solo is truly beautiful  The chorus is great  Headspace       Boom  Right after we hear a relatively slow song  Velvet Revolver comes back full throttle with Slash's addictive riff and Sorum's inspired drumming  and Weiland's vocals are truly hard hitting  Good chorus  and the lyrics for this song are great unlike some others  Superhuman       Starts off with a hard riff and loud base line  but slows down to just Weiland singing  But soon after the first chorus  it picks up to be a very hard rocker  Slash's solo sounds very spooky and follows the song's tone to a tee  Set Me Free        Starts off with a crazy riff from Slash that's followed up by Duff's bass line and Sorum's drumming that sets the stage for Weiland's vocals  that sound almost like B B  King surprisingly  The song picks up to become one of the hardest and fastest  so don't fret  Good chorus  and

Weiland's vocals aren't his best  but he sings the chorus as good as on any other song  Slash really steals the show here  with his crazy riff and his Guns N Roses y solo that is amazing  Fall to

Slash continues it on with his combination of acoustic and electric guitar playing that is phenomenal  and his solo is truly beautiful  The chorus is great  Headspace       Right after we hear a relatively slow song  Velvet Revolver comes back full throttle with Slash's addictive riff and Sorum's inspired drumming  and Weiland's vocals are truly hard hitting  Good chorus  and the lyrics for

              " \"Let me just come right out and say it  I think William Shatner's The Transformed Man is brilliant   brilliant  I say  It's easy to make fun of this album  especially the first few times you hear Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds or Mr  Tambourine Man   hey  I once made fun of Shatner's unique interpretations of these classics myself  The fact that Shatner doesn't actually sing tends to throw one off  When I got the chance to listen to the entire album  though  I was increasingly stunned by the realization that this unique recording was absolutely blowing me away  I have written a number of humorous reviews of very bad items  so I feel compelled to say that this is not one of them  Call it a novelty album if you like  but I sincerely believe this is one of the most underappreciated works of musical genius ever recorded  Heaven help me  but I really and truly love this album   The Transformed Man is not about Shatner trying to sing  he knows his dramatic reading style is not singing   this is a full blown concept album of remarkable proportions  I happen to believe Shatner took this album very seriously back in       and that this truly is about the music and not Shatner's ego or ersatz campiness  Shatner didn't just throw this album together  a lot of thought and work went into this  You'll notice that the first five tracks actually consist of two songs apiece  Each two part track is meant to reflect upon a different aspect of the duality of man  Of course  you don't get this effect when some radio station cues up Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds or Mr  Tambourine Man for comedic purposes  those guys never play the first half of each track  so it's impossible for the listener to know what Shatner was actually trying to do with this album  That is the main reason this album is universally looked upon as comedic  As he has described it in at least one interview  Shatner thought that the lyrics of some modern day songs were of literary merit  so in making this album he added a background of new  modern music to his readings of classic literary pieces  then juxtaposed this effect against his unique interpretations of modern songs with evocative lyrics delivered in a bold new fashion   Shatner's passionate reading of Hamlet's mad  suicidal soliloquy is amazing  conveying the very depths of emotional trauma and confusion  Some find his overdramatization campy  but I tell you I was moved by the force imparted in Shatner's impassioned delivery  Shatner's  must give us pause  line is indescribably powerful  I'm adding this line to my personal catchphrase repertoire  The dramatic reading of Hamlet melds into It Was a Very Good Year  rising from the depths of Hamlet's emotional trauma  Shatner now imparts a sense of frivolity and wonderfully subtle humor in his delivery  This song's nostalgic reflection of the past serves as a clear counterpoint to a young Hamlet's visions of a bleak future   Shatner recreates the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet  and then Romeo's pure love that could not go unspoken is transformed  in How Insensitive  into the implacable silence borne of a love that died   here is a man now asking himself how he could have reacted so emotionlessly and coldly to his once significant other at the end of that long ago love affair  The sounds of a bitter  desolate wind close out the final moments of the song  reinforcing the effect conveyed by Shatner's delivery  One of the more impassioned tracks on the album is Theme From Cyrano Mr  Tambourine Man  Cyrano is a marvel of self confidence  he has no desire to prostrate himself before others or to do anything that is not motivated by true art  After the transition to Mr  Tambourine Man  we find a man prostrate with inaction  desperately chasing after Mr  Tambourine Man in hopes of going anywhere and doing anything at all  The famous and much mocked final lines convey a sense of desperation so deep that it can no longer remain quiet   Shatner's Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds cannot be explained or described   it must be heard         of the world's population will think it's the most inane song ever recorded  as Shatner goes over the top and then some in his unforgettable delivery  but to me this is the centerpiece  the truly priceless masterpiece of this artistically significant album  a most forceful counterpart to Spleen's themes of dejection and darkness  It also provides a wonderful lead in to the album's final track  The Transformed Man  in which Shatner rises above the dual nature of human life and  in a moment of spiritual enlightenment  imparts the beauty and power of a philosophical epiphany   I honestly think The Transformed Man is uniquely bold and brilliant  but I don't want to mislead anyone  You would have to look long and hard to find anyone praising this album the way I have  for I am in the tiniest of minorities here  The odds are that you will find only unintentional comedy in this one of a kind recording  Either way  though  you come out a winner  you will either get an unlimited number of laughs from the album or you will actually see something quite amazing  unprecedented  and downright moving in Shatner's uniquely brilliant  unforgettable blending of literature  modern music  and reflections on the duality of man\",\n",
